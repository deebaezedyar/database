--Question 1 : simple query : get all the contacts from Anchorage, display the columns contact email, firstname and city ordered by contact_firstname
select * from contacts where contact_city ilike 'Anchorage';

select teacher_epita_email from teachers 
where teacher_epita_email not in (select distinct session_prof_ref from sessions)
order by teacher_epita_email asc;



-- Question 3 : harder query : compute the absence rate per student and per course, ordered by student epita_email ascending, course name ascending and absence rate descending
